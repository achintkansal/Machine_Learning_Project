# Introduction
Data imbalance across classes is a common cause of classification problems. This is the case when the size of examples from one class is significantly larger or smaller than the size of examples from the other classes. Many of these problems benefit from classifiers that perform well on the minority class. Using out-of-the-box classifiers for such problems may result in suboptimal results in terms of this goal. Here we studied and implemented several techniques for boosting classification performance with imbalanced datasets.
